## two development stages are there 
- video capture remain issue all are fixed (comming soon) 
- Release apllication in Ubuntu os 

#### Ending The Project(DUE TO PLACEMENT HADACHE FINISING PROJECT UPTO HERE WILL BE COMPLETE)

## What-If reopns the project
- adding google maps & developing & google lens
- upgrade Home 
- create mobile application development process
- upgrade newer versions & libraries 


- This is my first AI project, and although I haven't learned extensively about neural networks, I have implemented it using libraries such as GTK(Good To know), GUI (Graphical User Interface Toolkit), OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, and R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) Connected to CPU&GPU.

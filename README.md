- two development stages are there 
- 1) GUI with GTK application should be fix the bugs 
- 2) the coconames & openai library connection should be on all menu items 
- 3) Release apllication in Ubuntu os 

#### Ending The Project(DUE TO PLACEMENT HADACHE FINISING PROJECT UPTO HERE WILL BE COMPLETE)

# What-If reopns the project
- 1) create mobile application development process 
- 2) upgrade Home 
- 3) adding google maps & developing 
- 4) upgrade newer versions & libraries 


- This is my first AI project, and although I haven't learned extensively about neural networks, I have implemented it using libraries such as GTK(Good To know), GUI (Graphical User Interface Toolkit), OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, and R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) Connected to CPU&GPU.
